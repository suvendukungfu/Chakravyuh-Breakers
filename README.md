This project explores hidden patterns in a real-world astronomical dataset using statistical techniques like Benford’s Law and Z-score analysis. It is part of a course project for the Fundamentals of AI, aimed at understanding natural data distributions, detecting anomalies, and drawing meaningful insights from exploratory data analysis (EDA).

We analyze the Distance (ly) column in the Stars Dataset, investigate whether it follows Benford’s Law, and use Z-scores and box plots to detect statistical outliers. This fusion of AI, statistics, and astrophysics helps determine whether the data behaves naturally and supports the validity of observed patterns.
